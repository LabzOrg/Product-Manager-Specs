# AI Native Product Manager Rules

A comprehensive framework for AI-powered product management in modern software development environments.

## Overview

This repository contains the definitive meta rules and specifications for operating as an AI Native Product Manager agent. These rules are designed for AI assistants embedded in development environments (like AINative Studio, Cody, or any IDE with agentic support via MCP) to execute product management functions with consistency, rigor, and strategic clarity.

## What's Inside

The **AI Native Product Manager Rules** provide a complete operational framework covering:

- **Backlog & Requirements Management** - GitHub Issues integration, labeling strategies, and tracking
- **Product Strategy & Roadmapping** - Vision statements, MVP planning, KPI definition
- **Product Discovery & User Research** - Structured discovery processes, persona development, RICE prioritization
- **Requirements Definition & PRD Creation** - Comprehensive PRD templates with acceptance criteria
- **Reasoning & Product Thinking** - Decision frameworks and trade-off analysis
- **Metrics & Success Criteria** - Input/output/outcome metrics and measurement plans
- **Stakeholder Communication** - Executive summaries, sprint artifacts, go-to-market briefs
- **Risk Management** - Risk assessment frameworks and retrospective analysis
- **Cross-functional Collaboration** - Engineering and design handoff protocols
- **Self-Validation & Continuous Improvement** - Quality checks and decision logging

## Who This Is For

- **Product Managers** looking to leverage AI agents for product work
- **AI/ML Engineers** building agentic systems for product management
- **Development Teams** implementing AI-native workflows
- **Product Leaders** establishing standards for AI-assisted product operations
- **Tool Builders** creating AI-powered product management platforms

## Core Philosophy

This framework is built on three foundational principles:

1. **User Value First** - Every decision and artifact should clearly articulate user impact
2. **Data-Informed Decisions** - Validate assumptions early with metrics and research
3. **Cross-functional Clarity** - Enable seamless collaboration through structured communication

## How to Use

These rules can be implemented in several ways:

1. **As System Prompts** - Use as foundational instructions for AI product management agents
2. **As Process Guidelines** - Adapt sections for human PM workflows and team processes
3. **As Quality Standards** - Reference when reviewing product documentation and decisions
4. **As Training Material** - Onboard new PMs or train AI systems on product management best practices

## Integration

The rules are designed to work with:

- **GitHub Issues** - As the single source of truth for backlog management
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - For agent communication and state management
- **Standard PM Tools** - Adaptable to Jira, Linear, Asana, and other platforms
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Connects product decisions to development workflows

## Key Features

✅ **Structured Decision-Making** - Chain-of-thought reasoning for complex product decisions  
✅ **Comprehensive Artifacts** - PRDs, roadmaps, user stories, success metrics, risk assessments  
✅ **GitHub-Native** - Built for issue-driven development workflows  
✅ **Metrics-Driven** - Every feature includes measurable success criteria  
✅ **Cross-Functional** - Clear handoff protocols for engineering, design, and leadership  
✅ **Self-Validating** - Built-in quality checks and continuous improvement loops  

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Meta Rules document](./ai-native-pm-meta-rules.md)
2. Adapt sections relevant to your workflow and tooling
3. Configure your AI agent or development environment with these rules
4. Customize labels, templates, and frameworks for your organization
5. Iterate and improve based on team feedback
